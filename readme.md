# Computer Architecture Project

## Overview
This project consists of 2 python files which demonstrate the following

1. An LRU Cache Simulation
2. Three Branch Prediction Algorithms

The program receives a trace file from 'Test Files' and runs their simulations respectively
For the branch prediction code, the test files include a branch value, '@' for taken and '.' for not taken

Test Files were provided by Professor Confer

## Usage
`python3 cache_simulation.py testfile.txt`

`python3 branch_prediction_simulation.py testfile_wbranch.txt`
